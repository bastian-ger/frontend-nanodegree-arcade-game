## Description:
In this game you need to cross the screen and reach the water. When you reach the water, you get one point. If you hit a bug or a rock, you lose one point. At some points in the game you can see a key. If you collect the key, you are able to make the rock disappear by running into it. If you are able to remove a rock, you will see a gem, which you should collect quickly. As soon as you collected all three gems, you win a game. Be careful, after every won game the speed of the bugs will pick up!

## How to play the game:
Use the arrow keys of your keyboard in order to control your player. Press *up* to move upwards. Press *down* to move downwards. Press *left* to move to the left. Press *right* to move to the right.

## How you can start the game:
First, you need to download the zip-file on your computer and unzip all files.

You can either just start the default game by running *index.html* in your browser or you can open *js/app.js* and change the initial speed of the bugs. Go to end of the file, where you can read *Instantiation of enemy objects*. There you can find detailed instructions. You will need a text editor like *Atom* in order to open and change this file.
